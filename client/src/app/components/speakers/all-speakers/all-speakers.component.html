                  Drawing and painting flowers may seem like a first-year art student&#39;s assignment, but Lorenzo Garcia brings depth, shadows,
                  light, form and color to new heights with his unique and revolutionary technique of painting on canvas
                  with ceramic glaze. This session is sure to be a hit with mixed media buffs.
